# ELISA Data Analysis Tool - Project Proposal

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Python-based tool for automating the analysis of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) data. The tool will streamline the workflow from experimental design to data processing, ensuring consistency and reducing manual calculation errors.

## Project Goals
1.  **Automate Plate Layout**: Generate optimized sample layouts based on user constraints.
2.  **Data Processing**: Parse raw output from plate readers (Excel).
3.  **Analysis**: Perform calibration curve fitting, sample quantification, and quality control (QC).
4.  **Visualization**: Produce plots and statistical summaries.

## Functional Specifications

### 1. Experimental Design & Layout Generation
The user will provide the following inputs:
*   **Subject Name**: Identifier for the experiment/subject.
*   **Number of Samples**: Total count of unique samples.
*   **Replicates per Sample**: Number of technical replicates for each sample.

**Plate Logic:**
*   **Dimensions**: 8 Columns x 12 Rows (or transposed standard 96-well format as specified).
*   **Optimization**: The layout will be organized to minimize the number of rows used (filling columns first or sequentially).
*   **Calibration Standards**: The first two rows are strictly reserved for the calibration curve (performed in duplicate, one set per row).

### 2. Data Input
*   **Source**: Excel file generated by the plate reader.
*   **Parsing**: The tool will extract absorbance values from the 8x12 grid corresponding to the generated layout.

### 3. Data Analysis & QC
The analysis pipeline will perform the following steps:
*   **Calibration Curve**: 
    *   Construct the curve using the standard values from the first two rows.
    *   Fit a regression model (e.g., 4PL or linear) to interpolate concentrations.
*   **Sample Qualification**:
    *   Calculate mean absorbance and standard deviation for mapping samples.
    *   **Duplicate Check**: Calculate Coefficients of Variation (CV) to identify replicates with high variability (e.g., CV > 10% or 15%). Flag "bad" duplicates.
*   **Quantification**: Interpolate sample concentrations based on the calibration curve.

### 4. Output & Reporting
*   **Statistics**: Summary tables of calculated concentrations and QC flags.
*   **Plots**: 
    *   Calibration curve visualization with fit quality ($R^2$).
    *   Bar charts or scatter plots of sample concentrations.

## Technical Requirements
*   **Language**: Python
*   **Libraries**:
    *   `pandas` for data manipulation and Excel handling.
    *   `numpy` / `scipy` for curve fitting and calculations.
    *   `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for plotting.
    *   `openpyxl` for Excel IO.

## Future Enhancements
*   GUI for easier input management.
*   Support for multiple plates in a single run.
